Mpg data
1. The information about the gear type per model is in the column “trans”. Add a column to the data frame showing if the gear is ‘manual’ or ‘auto’. 
2. There are model strings which also contain the manufacturer name. Remove the manufacturer name in the models strings.
3. Write a function which takes the manufacturer name as input and returns all models belonging to the manufacturer as output. 
4. Create a data frame showing the average ‘displ’ value per year. There should be one column per year (wide format).
